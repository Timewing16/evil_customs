<p>Evil Customs has came a long way as It was Just a thought as first up until my Junior year of college I decided to take it futher. Selling logos for different brands and designing tattoos for the people around campus I decided to start my own coperation where I provide quick and easy access to ordering a logo. Majoring in Computer Science I had the vision to create this website making it easier for you guys to purchase logos without having to go through the middle man. Before the vision I also played college football at South Carolina State University finishing as 1x HBCU Celebration Bowl Champion, 2x Conference Champions.</p>
